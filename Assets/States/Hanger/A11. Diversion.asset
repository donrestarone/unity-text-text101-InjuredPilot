  storyText: 'Diversion


    In front of you is the expanse of the airship hangar.


    Festers are running everywhere and mostly yelling at one another. Some men are
    clambering aboard airships, others are attempting to put out fires that have started
    from the explosion.


    Who were those men? Friend or foe? That will have to wait. Time to get out of
    here.


    What now?

    1. Mad sprint to the nearest airship.

    2. Quick scrounge for weapons, then mad sprint to the nearest airship.'
