    You run down a long corridor then up a flight of metal stairs. They make a loud
    racket as you clamber up them. Thank goodness the machinery in this place is so
    loud.


    In front of you is the emergency exit door. It has an oversized, cast iron lock
    hanging from a bolted handle. You could try picking the lock, or maybe look for
    a way to pry it off.


    What to do?


    1. Pick it.

    2. Pry it.'
