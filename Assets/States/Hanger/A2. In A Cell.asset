  storyText: 'In A Cell


    Well, that was pretty stupid. You sustain a brutal beating and end up dumped in
    a dirty cell. The bars are thick cast iron. The door is old and patched together
    with plate metal and thick red wires.


    You have no idea where you are. And your head hurts.


    So, what to do now, slugger?


    1. Wait it out. My head hurts.

    2. Slam into the door with all my might.'
