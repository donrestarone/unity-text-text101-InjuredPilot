  storyText: 'Outside Hangar


    Festers. Everywhere. Armed mostly with gas-powered rock flingers.


    At least 10 of them guarding the hangar door. Typical.


    Could try punching your way through. Or sneaking the long way to the emergency
    exit.


    What should you do?


    1. Take them head on - rush the 10 guards.

    2. Sneak your way to the emergency exit.'
